# M1-Machine Learning-Official-Statistics

This module focuses on the application of machine learning for official statistics and SDG indicators.  We'll discuss why machine learning could be useful, and what are the limitations for using such techniques for official statistics. We also present some real-life applications of machine learning through interviews, focusing on the main characteristics of the projects.

The topics covered are: 
- Using Machine Leaning for Official Statistics
- Tools for applied Machine Learning
- Limitations of Machine Learning

Notes: We share a paper that has implemented Machine Learning for Official Statistics and SDGs Indicators
