# M6-Real-World-Machine-Learning

For this last module, we propose 2 different topics based on real-world examples of  implementing of Machine Learning project: 
- The first section was prepared in collaboration with the Statistics and Data Innovation Unit of the Asian Development Bank. You will follow, step-by-step, how to process satellite images in order to decipher indicators useful to predict poverty indicators. 
- The second section is devoted to Ethical considerations in Machine Learning, with some practical examples and a checklist proposed by the UK Statistics Authority

## Part one:  Estimating Poverty From Satellite Images

This section has been prepared in collaboration with the Statistics and Data Innovation Unit of the Asian Development Bank. In this section, related to the Real-World case Study: Using Satellite Images and ML to Estimate Poverty presentation, you will find important resources based on the  "Guidebook on Mapping Poverty through Data Integration and Artificial Intelligence" detailing, step-by-step, the process of processing satellite images to decipher indicators useful to predict poverty indicators at very fine level. You'll find some comprehensive resources, including tutorial-like videos that will guide you in using pedagogical code (Python & R) to replicate the process described in the [guidebook](https://www.adb.org/publications/guidebook-mapping-poverty-data-integration-ai).

The topic covered in this section include:
- Poverty mapping
- Processing Satellite Images
- Satellite image recognition using CNN
- Ridge regression
- Rescaling of Poverty estimates and visualization

## Part two:  Ethical Considerations in Machine Learning

Alice Toms is a Research Officer for the Centre for Applied Data Ethics (UK Statistics Authority). In her lecture, she introduce several important notions and principles that may help practitioners to reduce the potential issues due to missuses of ML algorithms.
