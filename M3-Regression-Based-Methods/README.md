# M3-Regression-Based-Methods

Multivariate Linear Regression is a corner stone in statistical analysis for analyzing the interactions between a variable of interest Y, and some explanatory variables X.  Regression can also be used in a Machine Learning framework to make predictions in regions where no observations were collected or on new samples. We present here some features of the regression and show how those models can be used in a Machine Learning setting when many (and possibly correlated) variables are available.

The topic covered in this module are: 
- Linear Regression and all his friends
- Selection of regressors
- Penalization Methods
- How to choose the best model?

Notes: We didn't provide slide dan video materials, but we share the R notes.
