# M0- Statistical Learning (You've seen this before)

This module serves mainly as a reminder or as a warm-up for the course. It  proposes a summary of statistical notions, terminology and basic concepts used by data analysts. This is why we subtitled it "You've seen this before". 

Even if some notions may be new to some, most are basic data science methods used throughout the course.

This module covers the following notions: 
- Linear and non-linear regression
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Statistical Learning vs Machine Learning
- Cross validation

Notes: We didn't provide slide dan video materials, but we share the R notes.
