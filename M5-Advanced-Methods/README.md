# M5-Advanced-Methods

Machine Learning methods are evolving very fast, some methods being challenged by new, more efficient ones at a high pace. These methods involve a high level of technicity and may require important efforts to apply. However, the roots of these advanced methods,  that are presented here,  are based on very intuitive ideas.  These seminal ideas embed important concepts needed for a deeper understanding of even more advanced methods. We highlight here their use in simple cases and using visual interactive tools.

The topics covered in this module are: 
- Support Vector Machines
- K-means (unsupervised learning)
- Neural Network (introduction)
