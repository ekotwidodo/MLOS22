# M2-Classification

Classification is one of the main domain of application of machine learning.  Methods for classification techniques, or classifiers, are not new and we'll present some classical, as well as some new techniques and compare the pros and cons of each method. We also highlight the importance of the different measures of fit to assess the quality of a classifier, and focus on the well-known logit as a classifier.

The topics covered in this module are:
- How classification works
- Supervised vs unsupervised classification
- Examples of classifiers
- Measures of fit
- Logit as a classifier
- How to choose the "best" model
